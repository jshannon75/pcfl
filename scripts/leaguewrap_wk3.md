PCFL: Week 3 wrap-up
================

### Last week’s games

| away\_team              | awaypoints | home\_team                  | homepoints |
| :---------------------- | ---------: | :-------------------------- | ---------: |
| Southern Sharks         |     130.10 | The G.O.A.T.                |     132.15 |
| First Timers The FTs    |     127.80 | Middle Earth Hangry Hobbits |     107.54 |
| Captain Clairvoyant     |     150.32 | Jumpin’ Jaheims             |     121.74 |
| KC Gophers              |     111.08 | Athens Team Sasquatch       |      97.48 |
| Pigskin on the Gridiron |      93.90 | Georgia Peanuts             |     125.70 |

Last week’s games were mostly comfortable wins, with one exception. The
Southern Sharks choked on the G.O.A.T., coming up just two points short.
The Jumpin Jaheims were our hard luck case for their week, as Evan’s 121
points would have beat five other teams. Unfortunately he was up against
our current points leader (Captain Clairvoyant), who scored the second
highest one week total thus far.

Here’s last week’s **10 best performing players.** The bench variable
shows whether they got left on the bench or not.

| name             | points | fullname              | bench |
| :--------------- | -----: | :-------------------- | ----: |
| Patrick Mahomes  |  40.00 | First Timers The FTs  |     0 |
| Alvin Kamara     |  39.20 | Athens Team Sasquatch |     0 |
| Russell Wilson   |  36.80 | Southern Sharks       |     0 |
| Tyler Lockett    |  33.50 | Jumpin’ Jaheims       |     0 |
| Josh Allen       |  31.24 | Jumpin’ Jaheims       |     0 |
| Justin Jefferson |  28.00 | First Timers The FTs  |     1 |
| James Robinson   |  27.90 | Georgia Peanuts       |     1 |
| Dak Prescott     |  27.48 | Southern Sharks       |     1 |
| Colts D/ST       |  27.00 | The G.O.A.T.          |     0 |
| Derrick Henry    |  26.00 | Captain Clairvoyant   |     0 |

Patrick Mahomes had another monster week, justifying his first round
draft status. Two other quarterbacks–Russell Wilson and Josh Allen–also
had excellent showings. Justin Jefferson had a breakout week (on the
bench) and I should have played James Robinson.

There were 11 players added last week. Which was the **best new
addition**?

| Ravens D/ST        |      1.0 | Middle Earth Hangry Hobbits          |
| Darren Waller      |      1.9 | Georgia Peanuts                      |
| Time for a new def | ense for | me (and also maybe for the Hobbits). |

Who won the **best scoring bench** award last week?

The FT’s and Sharks definitely showing some depth\!

Huge showdown next week between Captain Clairvoyant and the FT’s, our
\#1 and \#2 teams so far. Evan tries to notch his first win against me.
Our mismatch of the week is the G.O.A.T. vs. the KC Gophers, where Jacob
would appear to be heavily favored. We’ll see how it all plays out\!
