PCFL 2022: Week 1 wrap-up
================

It’s the first week of the new season! Welcome back, y’all. Good to be
playing fantasy with you again.

## Last week’s games

| Winner                      | Winner’s score | Loser                   | Loser’s score |
|:----------------------------|---------------:|:------------------------|--------------:|
| Middle Earth Hangry Hobbits |         148.06 | The Juniors             |         68.36 |
| The G.O.A.T.                |         116.66 | Georgia Peanuts         |         88.42 |
| KC Gophers                  |          98.28 | Southern Sharks         |         82.90 |
| Athens Team Sasquatch       |         115.68 | Captain Clairvoyant     |         93.62 |
| Jumpin’ Jaheims             |         115.72 | Pigskin on the Gridiron |        108.98 |

There were some close games with both stellar offense (Christine
vs. Sarah) and suffocating defense (Jacob vs. me). Let’s also note again
that Christine, who was not manually choosing players during our draft,
was the league’s high scorer. All that draft night strategy may not pay
off after all.

## Best performing players

### Best players overall

Here’s last week’s **10 best performing starters.**

| Player           | Position | NFL Team | Points | PCFL Team                   |
|:-----------------|:---------|:---------|-------:|:----------------------------|
| Justin Jefferson | WR       | MIN      |  34.90 | Middle Earth Hangry Hobbits |
| Josh Allen       | QB       | BUF      |  31.48 | Athens Team Sasquatch       |
| Saquon Barkley   | RB       | NYG      |  30.40 | The G.O.A.T.                |
| Jonathan Taylor  | RB       | IND      |  25.50 | KC Gophers                  |
| Cooper Kupp      | WR       | LAR      |  25.30 | The G.O.A.T.                |
| Davante Adams    | WR       | OAK      |  25.10 | The G.O.A.T.                |
| D’Andre Swift    | RB       | DET      |  25.00 | Pigskin on the Gridiron     |
| Jalen Hurts      | QB       | PHI      |  24.72 | Georgia Peanuts             |
| Ja’Marr Chase    | WR       | CIN      |  23.90 | Pigskin on the Gridiron     |
| Justin Herbert   | QB       | LAC      |  23.26 | Middle Earth Hangry Hobbits |

As is typical, this list is dominated by quarterbacks, none of whom are
a particular surprise. Kicking myself for not taking Kyler Murray. All
the others are wide receivers, with Tyreek Hill and Amari Cooper the top
two.

### Best players per team

Here’s last week’s top players **on each team.**
